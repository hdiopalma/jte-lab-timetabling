# Development Journal

An oral report of me spiralling into despair . . .
This journal is supposed to track my progress and discussing with myself about this project development, but sometimes somehow my personal feelings appear randomly and ruining my state of mind (and this journal, and this project, and everything), please keep it a secret if you read it and don't talk about it when we meet in real life.

(Lagi pura2 terobsesi buat mengalihkan pemikiran negatif dan permasalahan dunia selama ngerjain skripsi . . .
Setengah pura2 sih . . .)
